# 关于大语言模型（LLM）辅助生成内容的声明

鉴于开发者时间有限且能力尚有不足，本项目所有代码和文档内容（包括本声明在内）均在一个或多个环节中借助大语言模型（LLM）生成或优化，特此统一声明。若本项目为 fork ，则本声明仅适用于由本开发者新增或修改的内容，不涵盖原项目作者的部分。

LLM的应用范围包括但不限于：
- 思路与架构设计
- 函数及代码模块生成
- 代码结构与逻辑优化
- 问题排查与纠错
- 语言翻译
- 注释与文档撰写、润色
- 代码与文档排版

本项目的开发流程通常包括：构思 → 明确指令（Prompt） → LLM生成草稿 → 人工审核、优化与测试 → 正式发布。

虽然诸多内容在最终呈现前经过了一个或多个LLM辅助处理环节，但其核心思想、意图、逻辑架构及目标均由开发者明确提出，并通过精心设计的具体指令引导LLM进行生成与优化。在开发者看来，LLM已成为类似于集成开发环境（IDE）自动纠错、排版等基础工具，深度融入项目的各个环节。正如荀子《劝学》中所言：“君子生非异也，善假于物也。” 开发者坚信，合理利用先进工具，能够显著提升开发效率与成果质量。

开发者郑重声明，本仓库内所有经LLM辅助生成或优化的内容，均视同由开发者本人创作、审核，并在合理范围内承担相应责任。所有LLM辅助产出均经过开发者严格的人工审查与必要的测试，力求准确反映开发者意图，具备实际应用价值，避免冗余信息。上述流程确保LLM始终作为辅助手段，致力于提升项目质量并服务于开发目标。

然而，开发者的个人责任亦有其限度。受限于个人能力、精力及LLM工具本身的局限，无法保证所有内容在任何场景下均绝对准确、完全合规或无缺陷。极少数情况下，部分内容可能未能如预期运行，或无意中涉及侵权、违反相关法律条款，或产生其他不可预见的问题。此类情况均非开发者主观故意或恶意为之，而多源于LLM工具的局限性、训练数据的偏差或偶发生成结果。对于因使用本仓库内容而导致的任何直接或间接损失、法律责任或其他风险，开发者不承担连带或补充责任。

敬请各位用户在使用本仓库内容时，结合自身需求和具体应用场景，保持审慎态度，独立判断，并进行充分的测试与验证。如有疑问或发现问题，欢迎随时反馈与指正。感谢您的理解与支持！

# Statement on the Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Content Generation

In view of the developer's limited time and expertise, all code and documentation in this project (including this statement itself) have, at one or more stages, been generated or optimized with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). This statement is hereby issued for clarity. If this project is a fork, this declaration applies only to content added or modified by the present developer, and does not cover portions from the original project or its authors.

The application of LLMs includes, but is not limited to, the following aspects:
- Ideation and architectural design
- Function and code module generation
- Code structure and logic optimization
- Troubleshooting and debugging
- Language translation
- Documentation drafting, annotation, and refinement
- Code and documentation formatting

The typical development workflow for this project involves: ideation → prompt design → LLM-generated drafts → manual review, optimization, and testing → official release.

Although many contents have undergone one or more LLM-assisted stages before their final presentation, the core concepts, intentions, logical structure, and objectives are all proposed by the developer, who carefully guides the LLM via explicit prompts for generation and optimization. From the developer’s perspective, LLMs have become fundamental tools, akin to features such as auto-correction and formatting in integrated development environments (IDEs), and are now deeply integrated into all aspects of the project. As Xunzi wrote in "Encouraging Learning": "The gentleman is not born different from others; he is simply good at making use of external things." The developer firmly believes that judicious use of advanced tools can significantly enhance both development efficiency and the quality of results.

The developer solemnly states that all content in this repository generated or optimized with LLM assistance is regarded as personally created and reviewed, with reasonable responsibility assumed within appropriate limits. All LLM-assisted outputs undergo strict manual review and necessary testing by the developer, to accurately reflect the developer’s intentions, provide practical value, and avoid redundant information. This process ensures that LLMs always serve as auxiliary tools, with the aim of improving project quality and supporting development goals.

However, the developer's personal responsibility has its limits. Owing to constraints of personal capacity, time, and the inherent limitations of LLM tools, it is not guaranteed that all content will be absolutely accurate, fully compliant, or flawless in all scenarios. In rare cases, certain content may not function as expected, may inadvertently involve infringement, violate relevant legal provisions, or present other unforeseeable issues. Such situations are not the result of deliberate or malicious intent, but rather stem from the limitations of LLM tools, biases in training data, or accidental generation. The developer does not assume joint or supplementary liability for any direct or indirect losses, legal responsibilities, or other risks arising from the use of this repository's content.

Users are kindly reminded to exercise caution, make independent judgments, and conduct thorough testing and validation in light of their own needs and application scenarios when using any content from this repository. Should you have any questions or discover any issues, feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Thank you for your understanding and support!
